# Fashion MNIST Classification with Keras

In this project, we'll use the Fashion MNIST dataset to train a neural network to classify images of clothing items. We'll be using the Keras deep learning framework to define and train the neural network.

## Requirements

This project requires the following Python packages:

    numpy
    matplotlib
    keras

You can install them using pip:

    pip install numpy matplotlib keras

## Getting Started

First, let's import the necessary libraries:

import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from keras.datasets import fashion_mnist
from keras.utils import to_categorical
from keras import models
from keras import layers
We'll then load the Fashion MNIST dataset:

(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = fashion_mnist.load_data()
Next, we'll explore the dataset a bit:

print(len(train_images))
print(len(train_labels))

print(len(test_images))
print(len(test_labels))

print(test_images.shape)
train_images.shape
We can visualize one of the images using Matplotlib:

digit = test_images[120]
print("Class Label:", test_labels[120])

plt.imshow(digit, cmap=plt.cm.binary)
plt.show()
We can also print out the unique class labels:

print(train_labels)
print(np.unique(train_labels))

print(test_labels)
print(np.unique(test_labels))

## Building the Neural Network

Now, we'll define our neural network using Keras:

network = models.Sequential()

network.add(layers.Dense(512, activation='relu', input_shape=(28*28, )))
network.add(layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax'))

network.compile(optimizer='rmsprop',
                loss='categorical_crossentropy',
                metrics=['accuracy'])
We're using a simple architecture with two fully-connected layers. The first layer has 512 neurons and uses the ReLU activation function, while the second layer has 10 neurons (one for each class) and uses the softmax activation function to produce class probabilities.

## Training the Model

We're now ready to train the neural network. We'll use the fit() method to train the model on the training set for 5 epochs with a batch size of 128:

network.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=5, batch_size=128)

## Evaluating the Model

Finally, we'll evaluate the performance of the model on the test set:

test_loss, test_acc = network.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)
print('test_acc:', test_acc)
We print the test accuracy as the final metric.

That's it! We've built a neural network that can classify images of clothing items with high accuracy. With some tweaking of the neural network architecture and training parameters, we can likely improve the performance even further.
